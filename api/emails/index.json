That\r\ndebate is not over but any such discussions will now have to include\r\nrevelations about what is being termed \"FCAT Cleansing\" that has been\r\ntaking place within the nation's sixth largest public school system. \r\n\r\nA Broward Times investigation has uncovered contracts being used by some\r\nschools to expel students with low scores from the school system. These\r\ncontracts violate school district policy; possibly state education laws\r\nand even a child's constitutional right to a public education in\r\nFlorida.\r\n\r\nEntitled, \"Academic Attendance Contracts\" it reads:\r\n\r\n\"I understand that failure to comply with the above listed items, which\r\ninclude - attending school daily, attending all scheduled classes, being\r\npunctual to school daily, punctual to scheduled classes and following\r\nall disciplinary guidelines will constitute reason to withdraw me from\r\nschool and I should explore other educational avenues,\" reads one of the\r\ncontract students and their parents have been required to sign. \"I also\r\nunderstand that withdrawal from school may have an impact on my future\r\nearning potential,\" it further states. Any violation can be used as\r\ngrounds to withdraw the students from Broward public schools. \r\n\r\nInsiders within the school system say the agreement is used to get rid\r\nof under performing children who bring down a schools FCAT scores - a\r\npractice commonly referred as \"FCAT Cleansing\" because it removes lower\r\nscoring children whose grades are not included in the school's FCAT\r\ntallies or the school's overall grade. \r\n\r\nThe state of Florida administers bonus money to schools that achieve\r\nhigher grades under the FCAT scoring system. School officials expressed\r\nshock after learning about the contracts when contacted by The Broward\r\nTimes. \"Yes, we do have such contracts,\" explained board member\r\nStephanie Kraft. \"No, the board members, at least the current board\r\nmembers, myself included, did not authorize these specifically, although\r\nthere may be some language in our policy,\" she said. Kraft and other\r\nboard member directed Interim Schools Superintendent Jim Notter to\r\ndetermine how many schools have used the contracts and how many students\r\nwere withdrawn with a breakdown by ethnicity. \r\n\r\n\"I had heard there may have been some type of contracts and asked Dr.\r\nTill about it at a workshop, but this is very upsetting and disturbing\r\nto me,\" said board member Robin Bartleman. \"The board never authorized\r\nthis and no school or teacher has any authority to enter into any\r\ncontracts. I can not stress how much this troubles me,\" she said while\r\nassuring a full investigation would be undertaken. \r\n\r\nInterim superintendent Notter did not respond to emails or calls for\r\ncomments, but shortly after The Broward Times' inquiry, he issued a\r\ndistrict wide memorandum directing all schools to end the practice\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n\"It is my expectation that students who have been withdrawn from our\r\nschools as a result of these contracts will be afforded the opportunity\r\nto enroll in the various alternative education programs offered by\r\ndistrict,\" the memo said. A taskforce will also be implemented to study\r\nthe issue, it said. \r\n\r\nAfter a conference call among top district officials, an \"alert\" was\r\nsent to board members informing them the practice would be stopped after\r\nthe Broward Times questioned it. \r\n\r\nOne parent wondered if the terms of those contracts are being invoked\r\nafter schools conduct their Full Time Equivalency (FTE) counts. The FTE\r\ncounts the number of students enrolled in a school system during certain\r\nweeks of the year and those numbers are then used to determine the\r\namount of state and sometimes federal funding that system is eligible to\r\nreceive. The more students enrolled, the greater amount of funds it may\r\nreceive.\r\n\r\nUpon hearing about Notter's memo and the possibility that any students\r\nwithdrawn under the contracts may be able to go into an alternative\r\nprogram, one parent said that was totally unacceptable. That parent\r\nwanted her child returned to their regular school, but declined to speak\r\non the record, until they saw the memo and consulted with their\r\nattorney. \r\nSchool officials moved rapidly to distance themselves from the contracts\r\nand gave assurances they would conduct a thorough assessment of what has\r\nbeen taking place. \r\n\r\n\"It is not consistent with our policy. The minute you (The Broward\r\nTimes) raised this issue, we began our efforts to determine if it is\r\nhappening and if so, to what extent,\" said Dr. Earlean Smiley, deputy\r\nsuperintendent for curriculum and instruction. To her knowledge, Smiley\r\nsaid, \"no one in the senior administration was aware any such contracts\r\nwere being administered\" but she declined to speculate on any possible\r\naction that might be taken against staff who used the contracts.\r\n\r\nIt is unclear if the withdrawn students ended up on the streets, in some\r\ntype of trouble, or in one of the school district's alternative programs\r\nit sub-contracts to various firms, but board member Kraft said she has\r\nheard the attendance contracts were being used for improper reasons. \"I\r\nhave learned that some schools are routinely using these to exit\r\nstudents who may be bringing down the school grades, and that some\r\nschools are using them more than others,\" board member Kraft said. \r\n \r\nIf what she has heard prove accurate, then speculation of FCAT Cleansing\r\nin Broward School may have merit, which could trigger all sorts of\r\nactions. It may also lead to state revisions of the school district's\r\ngraduation rates, school grades and other data used to assess the level\r\nof effective learning in the system.\r\n \r\nRead More at:    <http://www.browardtimes.com/> www.BrowardTimes.com\r\n \r\n*NOTE\r\n \r\n\r\nThis important issue will be discussed on The Steve Kane Show with Elgin\r\nJones this Friday, Dec.1, 2006.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe show airs live from 6 to 9 a.m. on 1470 AM on the radio in South\r\nFlorida.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nListen LIVE on the Internet worldwide at:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nwww.SteveKaneShow.com\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe TOLL FREE number to call into the show is:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1-877-275-2326",

NC's focus on growing its financial\r\nservices sector, with leadership from the Governor's office and Department\r\nof Commerce - Secretary of Commerce Jim Fain spent 25 years with First\r\nUnion - is evident, and the $56 million Job Development Investment Grant\r\n(JDIG) is the largest ever.  That's the same incentive that I was fighting\r\nfor the Project Eden (Deutsche Bank) 5,000 to 7,000 employee Operations/IT\r\ncenter which led to the formation of FFSCI to secure High Impact\r\ndesignation for financial services and help to level the incentives\r\nplaying field.

One does not then turn and\r\nalter the identification of the statutes as something else to hide the\r\nright from the American people.\r\n\r\nUnless one is in Florida of course.\r\n\r\nYou will not leave office until you are aware of the contents of that\r\nhearing tape.\r\n\r\nCathy Butler\r\n\r\nHearing Officer Mary Poplin (MP) Opens:\r\n\r\nThis hearing requested on behalf of Cathy Butler, Today is September\r\n21st, 2006, it is 1:58 p.m., and we are in Lake Worth Florida, Lake\r\nWorth, Florida,  the Appeal  number assigned to today\u0092s case is  06f5266\r\n\r\nWould all those  present please state their name and address or name and\r\ntitle for the records\r\n\r\nOk, I am Cathy Butler, 1916 Breezy Lane, West Palm Beach, Florida, 33417\r\n\r\nMira Quentez (sp) I found myself  efficiency  supervisor 4220 Lake Worth\r\nRoad, Lake Worth, Florida, 32462\r\n\r\nWould all those present  please begin testimony, please raise your right\r\nhand.

I am the hearing officer assigned to today\u0092s\r\nproceedings; now I make independent decisions as to weather this\r\ndepartments actions in this matter is correct. My decision is based on\r\nall the pertinent rules, regulations and statutes. My decision is final\r\nfor the department. Now then, Ms. Butler if you disagree, you may seek\r\nfor Judicial Review. I would like to take this  time to remind you that\r\ntoday\u0092s proceedings are being recorded and become part of the permanent\r\nrecord. I also ask at this time if you have a cell phone that you place\r\nit on silent or to turn it off. At this time I need to establish the\r\nissue at today\u0092s hearing. Do you have the notice of Case Action?\r\n\r\nMQ: I have a notice of case action for her daughter\u0092s Medicaid, we have\r\nnot taken action on her Medicaid, yet it um is still pending, Uh the\r\noffice of Disability Determination has not made a final determination\r\nyet.\r\nUh I believe we are here because of she has not gotten a decision on\r\nMedicaid on her not being approved  is that why Ms. Butler?\r\n\r\nCB, um,\r\n\r\nMQ; Her daughter does have Medicaid. And that is the only notice of\r\ndecision that I can give you. Because her Medicaid is still on pending\r\nstatus.\r\n\r\nCB: My name is Cathy Butler and I want, I want  a copy of this case. I\r\nwant that on official records including the statements just made. Um, my\r\ndaughter was appointed on Medicaid through the Healthy Kids program. She\r\nis on Medicaid, she has been approved,  this is not about my daughter\r\nunless we got a new  issue I don\u0092t know anything about.\r\n\r\nMP: OK. It\u0092s not about your daughter. What about is the issue about\r\nbriefly so I can assign burden of proof.\r\n\r\nCB: Thank you. Um. I applied for Medical Emergency, it is on record, I\r\nwas denied, they came back and told me it was based on  my daughter\r\nbeing 18 years old.\r\n\r\nMP: OK. Let me, let me see if the notice of case action.\r\n\r\nMQ: We haven\u0092t given the\r\n\r\nMP: for the daughter.\r\n\r\n(MP is heard searching through paperwork several seconds)\r\n\r\nCB: OK, I am going to....\r\n\r\nMP: Ms. Butler, I need to establish the issue first.\r\n\r\nCB: Ok.\r\n\r\nMP. OK. This says, that Medicaid was approved  for your daughter, and\r\nthat you were ineligible for Medicaid. Were you refusing to Medicaid\r\nprior to this action?\r\n\r\nCB: No\r\n\r\nMP: You\u0092ve not ever been receiving Medicaid?\r\n\r\nCB: I got it before, prior, yes.  I had it 3 years ago when they\r\ndiscovered the problem with the breast and the doctor dismissed it.\r\n\r\nMP: OK. When did you apply for Medicaid. When , when is the date of\r\napplication for the disability?\r\n\r\nMQ: For Ms. Butler?\r\n\r\nMP: Yes.\r\n\r\nMQ: July 31st, is the application. for her  In which she only wrote on\r\nherself,  does not her daughter, then  we added her daughter  onto her\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nMP:OK.  So on July 31st, you submitted an application for Medicaid for\r\nyourself? For disability study.\r\n\r\nCB Um Huh.   Absolutely.\r\n\r\nMP: At this time today is September 21st, and the department has not\r\ntaken action yet? No action from DDD?\r\n\r\nMQ: We, uh, processed the DDD case, and sent it to Tallahassee to make a\r\ndetermination.\r\n\r\nCB: No, that is not what I applied for. I applied for the Medical\r\nEmergency, my daughter as records will show was already on Medicaid, and\r\nshe did not have to be given Medicaid.\r\nMP: She is not talking about your daughter, she is talking about you.\r\n\r\nCB: I know, we are trying to switch my daughter\u0092s situation\r\nindependently with mine.\r\n\r\nMP: No. I need to know what you applied for.\r\n\r\nCB: I applied for the Medical Emergency.\r\n\r\nMP: Is there Medicaid for the Medical Emergency?\r\n\r\nMQ: There\u0092s a Medicaid for  uh Emergency Medicaid, for aliens, for uh\r\nnon citizens which do not qualify under regular Medicaid criteria, but\r\nits just like a regular Medicaid we have to meet technical also, either\r\ndisability or the, or the have children, under aging.  Its the same\r\ntechnical that would be required for you but we just call it emergency\r\nalien care.\r\n\r\nCB: OK. So you are saying that an alien qualifies for Medicaid emergency\r\neven though you  state you submit information that I need emergency\r\ntreatment?\r\n\r\nMP: Mrs. Butler, that is not the issue here. The issue here is your\r\napplication for Medicaid for a disability, what is your date of birth?\r\n\r\nCB: 4-3-58\r\n\r\nMP: Is there Medicaid for Ms. Butler?\r\n\r\nMQ: No.\r\nMP: Do you have children under 18 living in the home?\r\n\r\nCB: No. I do not.\r\n\r\nMP; OK.\r\n\r\n(mubling by case worker and hearing officer)\r\n\r\nMP; and what is........\r\n\r\nMQ: The policy is that um, uh she can qualify for Medicaid, uh under the\r\n1931\r\n\r\n MP:        Who can qualify?\r\n\r\nMQ: Ms. Butler if she has a child under 18 years old,  in the household\r\nor ether  she would have to be  65 years old, or be determined disabled.\r\n\r\n\r\nCB. Well we have a pending disability that no one will respond to.\r\n\r\nMP; So that\u0092s the issue; the time length of time it has taken the\r\ndepartment..\r\n\r\nCB. We have four different things going on here. Um.\r\n\r\nMP:  I need to know, I need you to define the issue.\r\n\r\nCB. Its extremely simple. I have a breast that is bleeding that has been\r\ndemanded a surgeon, medical treatment. This is supplied by the Health\r\nDepartment, copies were sent to DCF. DCF decided to put it under the 18\r\nyear old law. A medical emergency is a medical emergency. I don\u0092t have\r\nto be an alien in order to acquire medical treatment during a medical\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\nMP: Ok. Right now the issue is, no action taken on the disability study\r\n\r\nCB: I got a notice today that I could re-apply by the Director of\r\nSecretary of uh, Health Department.\r\n\r\nMP: I have no jurisdiction over the Department of Health so.....\r\n\r\nCB: Well, he pretty much dismissed this case prior to me walking in\r\nhere. So we file complaints.\r\n\r\nMP: OK, well I have no jurisdiction over the department of health. Right\r\nnow I have jurisdiction over the department of children and families,\r\nand the length of time, there has been no action taken on the DDD\r\ndisability, from July 31st.\r\n\r\nCB: With a life threatening situation.\r\n\r\nMP: Ok with a life threatening situation. OK. This is an application for\r\nMedicaid?\r\n\r\nMQ: Yes.\r\n\r\nMP: Ok, this is an application. Ms. Butler you have the burden of proof\r\nYou will present your testimony first as to why you feel it should be,\r\nbeen approved before now, the department will present their testimony to\r\njustify why it has not been approved, and then you may ask questions of\r\neach other.  And there is no notice because there has been no decision,\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\nMQ. Correct.\r\n\r\nMP: OK I don\u0092t have jurisdiction if there\u0092s not been a decision, there\u0092s\r\nno collective action to which demands...\r\n\r\nCB: Which decision are we talking about?\r\n\r\nMP: We are talking about the length, I do have jurisdiction on delay, if\r\nthere is a delay in service for the length of time it has taken the\r\ndepartment to make a decision on your disability, I can review those\r\nissues. And I,  but on record, I have no jurisdiction over the\r\nDepartment of Health in this matter.\r\n\r\nCB: So the Department of Health and Social Security are the same thing.\r\n\r\nMP: Well, they are not, they are not here.\r\n\r\nCB: According to the Federal law, uh the statutes combine them. Medicaid\r\nand SSA are the same.\r\n\r\nMP: Well. I can\u0092t be, I am not responsible for social security.\r\n\r\nCB: I did not make the laws up, the federal did.\r\n\r\nMP: Right.  I can tell you  right now that I will hear the issue of the\r\nlength of time it has taken the Department to make a decision on your\r\ndisability.  OK?\r\n\r\nCB: OK\r\n\r\nMP: OK are you ready to proceed on that?\r\n\r\nCB. Absolutely. July 31st, I filed a online application, I listed the\r\nproblems, I went immediately to the Health Department, the Health\r\nDepartment listed it as is witnessed in a uh diagnosis that was sent\r\nover to the Children and Families, having bleeding breasts, it was uh,\r\nsevere enough that they immediately sent me down within I think uh two\r\nweeks. This is from a, I can not read her name I did not wear my\r\nglasses,\r\nOrsena, M.D., bilateral mammogram  she requested, based on (Incoherent)\r\n, quatamedia, I can\u0092t pronounce it, which means you have a bleeding\r\nbreast.  That is a diagnosis.\r\n\r\nMp. OK.\r\n\r\nMP OK\r\n\r\nCB: This was faxed over to the intake workers, she demanded that I\r\nprovide, one of her issues  that she have was that I needed to as this\r\nevidence show, show proof of child support, even though she knew my\r\ndaughter was on SSA, and I had to show proof of insurance which is\r\nirrelevant to my medical condition.\r\n\r\nMP: Ok you had to show what?\r\n\r\nMQ: Insurance\r\n\r\nCB: Insurance.\r\n\r\nMP: OK.\r\n\r\nCB. That is in her handwriting. (showing paperwork to hearing judge)\r\n\r\nMP: OK.\r\n\r\nCB: What I did do because it was according to the doctors a very severe\r\ncase of what they  believe is second degree , or second stage cancer,\r\nand that was early diagnosed and DCF was ,\r\n\r\nI need that back please.\r\n\r\nMP: You, all copies will be made after the hearings and they will be\r\nmarked as for evidence.\r\n\r\nCB: OK. I need the original.\r\n\r\nMP: You will have them.\r\n\r\nCB: Um, they were sent that, the case worker on there,  after I sent 21\r\nsomething pages of evidence and everything she said she needed it\r\nbecause I was trying to rush it simply because they said you are going\r\nto die. That was basically what was told to me. Uh, faxed it over,\r\ncontacted her, she laughed, she said, \u0093You wasted your time because we\r\nare going to go under the 18 year of my daughter, and I informed them\r\nand I have stacks of papers you are aware the reason I write emails or\r\nthe reason I write letters, most of that is to document.\r\n\r\nMP. OK\r\n\r\nCB; And I wrote them this had nothing to do with her being 18 years old,\r\nand the very fact that she is being applied for with disability with\r\nmedical proof, puts you in a leave way of discretion, that based on\r\nthe evidence already been submitted, I do have a disabled child.\r\n\r\nMP: OK, right so she\r\n\r\nCB But we dismissed that.\r\n\r\nMP: But  she, you said she was not the issue.\r\n\r\nCB: Now what they did send me which was interesting and I talked to\r\nother people who couldn\u0092t believe it, was an unsigned letter with no\r\ndetermination. No determination. That was my dismissal of the case. On\r\nthe back it gave the location to the Health Department. So we\r\ntechnically don\u0092t have a dismissal.\r\n\r\nMP: That is exactly what Ms. Quetez said, there has been no decision.\r\n\r\nMQ; Its a pending decision from the disability office\r\n\r\nCB: Because the children and families have chosen to acknowledge  that a\r\nbleeding breast is potentially cancerous  and is life threatening to the\r\nextend two months with an emergency medical situation even though they\r\nhave files that show very clearly that this is a medical emergency, that\r\nthey have radiologist demanding according to the Jupiter Women\u0092s Center,\r\nthey have doctors diagnosing a problem with the right breast, medical\r\nrecords, they have ASAP on the medical files, we have a history that\r\nthey were faxed over m three years ago where the doctor acknowledged the\r\nproblem even though he had knowledge and evidence it was there. He was\r\nalso a Medicaid doctor, he is uninsured, he doesn\u0092t have to report to\r\nthe state that he\u0092s had complaints Being uninsured for him, the solution\r\napparently was to send me home.\r\n\r\nHe never took a Biopsy, he never took a test, he did no further studies,\r\nby all medical procedures by what I understand with a lump in the left\r\nbreast the procedures were to take a biopsy, when he had recognized\r\npotential cancer in the right breast from what we understand was in\r\nfiles, it demanded attention. Three years later I am living proof he\r\nviolated the law.\r\n\r\nWe have the Jupiter Center here, radiologist, suspicious abnormality of\r\nthe right breast, biopsy recommended surgical consultation also to\r\nadvice the patients right bloody nipple discharge. It\u0092s been recognized\r\nthree times.\r\n\r\nMP: OK\r\n\r\nCB Medically by radiologist. It was found that the left breast\r\napparently they hoped was benign and from what we understand we expected\r\nthat because usually the other breast will go into sympathy with the one\r\nthat has cancer. So far these dates on this, this was sent on  for press\r\nand faxed over to their agency, it was faxed out on the 16th,\r\nimmediately after.\r\n\r\nMP: By which month.\r\n\r\nCB: Uh, it looks like August. So we are sitting here almost one month\r\nlater with the knowledge that I might have cancer, and instead of taking\r\nthe type of  action that the law states has to be taken in medical\r\nemergency, we are holding hearings.\r\n\r\nMP: Do you have the statutes that allow for the sixty day continuance\r\nof Medicaid medical emergency.\r\n\r\nCB: According to them, it was done, it was done, it was finished, it was\r\n18 years old, it was go away, go to the health department, good luck\r\nhave fun are you enjoying yourself, and I can tell you something, when I\r\nget some individual, and you can tell from my emails how determined I\r\nam, when I get an individual that I have on my answering machine, when I\r\nam attempting to get hold of a supervisor, that we have a life and death\r\nsituation, and to be honest      had it been my daughter, my neighbor or\r\nany other person, knowing that person had that condition I would have\r\ngone to any Administrator, and said we have to do something.\r\n\r\nI had a gentleman call me up and give me a 1-800 number and when you\r\ncall that number it tells you to call another so you can be happy. I\r\nwould rather not be insulted by the department. And this is consistent,\r\nabsolutely consistent To me when you send me information that you send\r\nme, and I have more at home, knowing this type of information, and you\r\nsend out a letter like this, that dismisses your case without even\r\ntelling you why, you have insulted me.\r\n\r\nMP: Is anything else....\r\n\r\nCB: You have degraded me.\r\n\r\nMP: Did anything else come with this?\r\n\r\nCB: No.\r\n\r\nMP: There is a dimple mark in it.\r\n\r\nCB : I think its probably one of the case ...........oh the dimple? I\r\nuse my wall as a board. Considering I am doing her work, my work,\r\nmedical work, and I am in college, uh, astronomical. My, my board is my\r\n, I just tack everything up so I don\u0092t loose it.\r\n\r\nMP: Ok. OK.\r\n\r\nMP: Ms. Quentez?\r\n\r\nMQ: That would be a lot of times when we are uh, we have a case pending,\r\nor a reason to take after three months we usually send that to the\r\nclient so they can go to the Health Department to get a clearance. Uh,\r\nthe Application that we got on July 31 was assigned to my unit, DDD\r\ndetermination of August 10th, on August 15th, ms Sandra Benneli,\r\nattempted several times to speak with Ms. Butler, to schedule her an\r\nappointment, to come in. Um, apparently the time was not good for Ms.\r\nButler, Ms. Butler did not want to come into the office, she said she\r\nshould not have come in for an interview. All the DDD determinations we\r\nhave for the client come in at that time we take all that information\r\nfrom all other providers, she said were treating her for her condition,\r\nand, you know, we are supposed to get as much information as we can\r\nbecause the more we have the better the case looks for you. Um, there\r\nwas no co-operation by Ms. Butler, a lot of threatening, verbal\r\nthreatening, she was going to contact this office, the other office, and\r\nuh, there was nothing done over the phone. Finally after calling program\r\noffice, they contacted us, they said,  they said, try to do it over the\r\nphone, and just mail her the financial releases. We got the financial\r\nreleases on  August 25th. At which time we submitted it to Tallahassee,\r\nthat is when we were able to submit the packet. And so far they have not\r\nmade the determination yet.\r\n\r\nMP: OK so submitted um.\r\n\r\nMQ: Tallahassee just contact the providers, um there really was not much\r\ninformation, you did not send us medical records, but you know that, to\r\nhave a copy here which we showed her,\r\n\r\nCB, I , I filmed you being sent\r\n\r\nMQ: We did submit that with the packet.\r\n\r\nMP: What did you submit?\r\n\r\nMQ: {Ruffling papers) basically just letters from her but not medical\r\nrecords.  This is what we submitted she has a copy of.  The only thing\r\nthat she provided to us. As far as her medical condition. mumbling.\r\n\r\nCB: I just wanted to add\r\n\r\nMP: After this department finishes.\r\n\r\nCB OK\r\nMQ (Still shuffling papers)\r\n\r\nMP: And this information here is the application? In the eligibility?\r\n\r\nMQ: Yes.\r\n\r\nMQ: And also Ms. Butler is required to go to social security\r\nadministration, that is still pending, I don\u0092t know weather you have\r\ndone it or not. To go to Social Security and Apply for disability\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\nCB: Can I ask you a question?\r\n\r\nMQ: And provide me with proof you have done that. Because lets say,\r\noffice of uh disability determination\r\ngoes in your favor and they tell us the patient has been approved, we\r\nstill need to get from you proof you went to Social Security\r\nAdministration.\r\n\r\nCB OK\r\n\r\nMQ And heres a copy of her I made a copy of her pending letter.\r\n\r\nMumbling MP and MQ I think I gave it to you.\r\n\r\nCB: Do you need a copy of the medical, what I have?\r\n\r\nMP to MQ : This is the pending order?\r\n\r\nMQ; Yes\r\n\r\nMP: Through application information benefits and this was sent on\r\n\r\nMQ August 11th,\r\n\r\nCB I don\u0092t believe this is in my records, something I have never seen\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nMP: OK. Ms. Butler I am going to ask you  wait until the department is\r\nfinished and then you can ask questions. OK. So the only medical\r\nevidence you submitted was the DDD package which is short for Division\r\nof Disability Determinations was the Palm Beach County health department\r\nBilateral\r\n\r\nMQ Yes (non determinal)\r\n\r\nMP: OK. When is the time standards for disability determination?\r\n\r\nMQ: They have 90 days but they can take longer depending on the case, if\r\nthere's not much, for them to go by, which we did not have much. From\r\nthe conversations with Ms. Beneli, with the worker, uh, Tallahassee,\r\nthey said, that  it was an old diagnosis from years ago and it really\r\nwas not much for now,\r\n\r\nMP: But they had not made a formal decision.\r\n\r\nMQ: They had not made a formal decision.\r\n MP: And they have ninety days to do so, and the application was July\r\n31st and today is September 21st\r\n\r\nMQ: We submitted the DDD package, that is when we actually count, when\r\nwe they get it, that is when we received her financial releases.\r\n\r\nMP: OK\r\nMQ: We can not do anything, unless we have those.\r\n\r\nMP: OK Ms. Butler, are you finished Ms. Quentez? OK now you can  rebut\r\n\r\nCB: Thank you. First of all I understand the agency after the  comments\r\nmade to me, the harassments, the telephone calls and the  threats, I\r\nfilmed sending you the medical packages. So you have sat here under here\r\nstating under oath something different. I filmed it.\r\n\r\nMQ; And this is the item we have.....\r\n\r\nCB I filmed it.\r\n\r\nMQ: This is it.\r\n\r\nCB: That is what you are going to stick with. Now second of all you sent\r\nme a release and I faxed to  you a release to get the medical files, did\r\nyou ever  get that?\r\n\r\nMQ: Vaguely, we\r\n\r\nCB: So you DO have the medical records available to you. Am I correct?\r\n\r\nMQ; Based on........\r\n\r\nCB: Did you have access to gain them?\r\n\r\nMQ: I did not process this case,  I am here representing the department\r\nfor your case and that's the only thing she has here, she has not\r\nreceived any other information, she would have it in here.\r\n\r\nCB: OK. Did you have the ability to gain and have faxed over to you as\r\nthe Health Department did on this thing within days of the diagnosis, to\r\nyour office?\r\n\r\nMQ: Um what did I say  here, ada did I (inauderable) the clerks log\r\nanything that comes in.  [still handing evidence to judge without\r\nallowing me to see it as the law requires]\r\n\r\nCB: and I can provide fax records and filming. Now did you have access\r\nto gaining my medical records with knowledge I was in a Medical\r\nEmergency situation?\r\n\r\nMQ: Did I have access,? Could you  just rephrase your question  I don\u0092t\r\n(mumbled)\r\n\r\nCB: Could you have called up the Jupiter Hospital or the Health\r\nDepartment because you had a medical release sent to you?\r\n\r\nMQ; The medical release, those are, for um the DDD department. They will\r\nreject (inauderable)\r\n\r\nCB: So when you send out for an individual requesting that they permit\r\nyou, As Mr. Marly told me, we can not accept your faxes, we have to have\r\na form filled out, and I will send it to you, and you sign it.\r\n\r\nMQ: That is for the DDD department and they will request those records.\r\n\r\nCB: OK.\r\n\r\nMQ: We don\u0092t request them here.\r\n\r\nCB : You have the ability to gain the records from day one.\r\n\r\nMQ: But we don\u0092t do it because we do NOT make your determination. They\r\nwill do it, do that for you.\r\n\r\nCB. You are saying to me, you are saying on record that nothing was\r\navailable when everything was available.\r\n\r\nMQ:Was the Bennelli interview, , did you give her the Name of the\r\nJupiter medical center and the phone number?\r\n\r\nCB  Absolutely. Not only that I sent her copies.\r\n\r\nMQ: OK. Ms. Benelli put that information on the computer, and the office\r\nof Disability Determination will request from those places that you gave\r\nher the information.\r\n\r\nCB:  You were sent the medical information.\r\n\r\nMP: Ok Ms. Butler, you r point has been noted on record.\r\n\r\nCB: [to MQ] You have sat there and stated that is the only thing you\r\nobtained and you could not make a decision.\r\n\r\nMQ: Basically. We do not make the decision. We send them what we have.\r\nWhat ever information you gave Ms. Benneli that is what will go to uh,\r\nDDD.\r\n\r\nCB  OK. And the 21 pages that were faxed over to the original case\r\nworkers, with the medical information, 21 pages.\r\n\r\nMQ: We have here what they handed to us.  I am not\r\n\r\nCB OK. So our records are not matching\r\n\r\nMQ: You are talking about medical records or letters, because we have\r\nevery letter that you sent.\r\n\r\nCB. There\u0092s a reason. I would\u0091t you know, , go there.\r\n\r\nMQ: Whatever you sent us. We have here.\r\n\r\nCB But you were sent very first automatically after that first request,\r\nnot only did I send the information you requested  but I sent\r\n\r\nMQ; You were dealing with many agencies, you were working with\r\n\r\nCB Yes mam\r\n\r\nMQ: Program office\r\n\r\nCB Yes mam\r\n\r\nMQ: Because You could have sent it too.\r\n\r\nCB Do you know why I sent it to them?  Because For this reason. I wanted\r\nto make sure somebody out there had it and nobody could deny it.\r\n\r\nMP: Do you have the records available now?\r\n\r\nMQ; What every, what we have here. [rustlng of papers]\r\n\r\nCB: And that is why so many people were contacted for exactly what is\r\ngoing on here. So we had back up that agency, after agency, person after\r\nperson, had the knowledge was given the knowledge, and took no action.\r\nThat\u0092s why we did it.\r\n\r\nCB; It was not an insult on you or an insult on them. It merely was just\r\nwe know the system. We knew this would happen and we were prepared.\r\n\r\nMQ: We took action immediately after you sent the letters.\r\n\r\nCB: It is the 21st of September, I applied July 31st. I told, was told\r\nby the radiologist and the nurses don\u0092t go over four weeks with on this\r\nbecause on four weeks you might have it travel to your liver, or your\r\nlungs, and you may not know about it. Or to your brain.\r\n\r\nMQ: I will be glad to give you a referral to the Health Care District as\r\nsoon as we are done here, so you can you know.........\r\n\r\nCB: Why would I go to the health Care district when on their report, I\r\ndon\u0092t know if I brought them or not, what they have written across the\r\ntop of their report  in their medical and I can provide that to your\r\noffice, on the top of their report instead of putting it in the\r\nfinancial, they discuss my Medicaid all the way down. Now that is the\r\nDistrict Director that did that. And I was told until I got Medicaid\r\nthey would not refer me. It is provable by the discussion of Medicaid on\r\nmy medical files.\r\n\r\nMQ: And when was this done?\r\n\r\nCB: It was done about the same time this was done. I went down to gain\r\nthe files and it cost me thirty dollars.\r\n\r\nMQ: That's, that\u0092s from the, the Health Department.\r\n\r\nCB Health Department.\r\n\r\nMQ: Did you apply for it that day or today\r\n\r\nCB: On the record, they are denying me a referral based on the fact that\r\nyou would not approve Medicaid.\r\nAnd that will be faxed to your office.\r\n\r\nMP: OK are there any other questions?\r\n\r\nMP: Do you have any other questions or testimony Ms. Butler?\r\n\r\nCB Um.........\r\n{Tape runs out, turned over}\r\n\r\nAccording to, You have a very simple situation here. I am going to die\r\nif I do not get medical treatment. The state of Florida under the\r\nFederal Law is required to take care of those with a medical emergency\r\nmedical situation. The Medical documents are available, have been faxed,\r\nhave been documented, have been sent, numerous times to make sure every\r\nagency got it, it becomes a choice of the State of Florida.\r\n\r\nMP: The Department only has this one on records.\r\n\r\nCB: That is the one they provided you with. I will show you different\r\nrecords.\r\n\r\nMP: Where... are the different records?\r\n\r\nCB: I will provide that......I believe, I believe  I did fax them to\r\nTallahassee. Immediately after because they were supposed to send them\r\nup to DDS.\r\n\r\nMP: That's not what you faxed to me.\r\n\r\nCB, This was ...\r\n\r\nMP: Oh. Wait a minute.\r\n\r\nCB: Quite a few days ago.\r\n\r\nMP: I do have,  I do have, your information from Jupiter Medical Center.\r\n\r\n\r\nCB: Um hum, exactly.\r\n\r\nMP: and the accompanying notes.\r\n\r\nCB: Um hum.\r\n\r\nMQ: Three years ago when you were eligible for Medicaid, not even three\r\nyears ago, when did your daughter turn 18?\r\n\r\nCB: March 23rd.\r\n\r\nMQ: Surprising that, why didn\u0092t you  pursue your Medicaid\r\n\r\nCB: Did you look at the docking well? I didn\u0092t have a reason to pursue\r\nMedicaid. And let me explain something about going down to the Social\r\nSecurity Office. By  Florida and Federal Law you  can not file false\r\ncases. I can not walk into Social Security and say I am going to apply\r\nfor disability, but I don\u0092t have anything to go on.\r\n\r\nMQ: No. Not disability application. To go to a doctor using your regular\r\nMedicaid, then you would have been eligible.\r\n\r\nCB: What,  What regular Medicaid?\r\n\r\nMQ; Then you would have been eligable under medicaid.\r\n\r\nCB : I want. Whoa. I, files show, I did everything medically that I was\r\nallowed to do. Now the doctors, no the doctors , the files show the\r\ndoctor sent me home, clean bill of health. The Doctor did. If you got a\r\nproblem with what the Doctor did, we are all going to take that one up.\r\nI can not walk into, and apply legally into your social security without\r\nproof I need to because then I am committing fraud because I have no\r\nproof.\r\nThat is federal law. That means once I walk into that office, and apply\r\nand say: \u0093 I think I have a problem, I don\u0092t have any medical diagnosis,\r\nbecause I can not get Medicaid to prove to you, I can be arrested for\r\nfalsely applying.\r\n\r\nMQ: You don\u0092t have to have a condition  in order to be , to be eligible\r\nfor Medicaid, that's why you need to meet our criteria.\r\n\r\nCB: What would you , what would you suggest that  I walk in and apply\r\nwith ?\r\n\r\nMQ: At this point?\r\n\r\n\r\nCB: For a disability. What would you suggest I apply with?\r\n\r\nMQ: Mam I am not talking about going to apply back for disability, just\r\nregular Medicaid and why you  would not qualify.\r\n\r\nCB: What would I walk into social security and hand them, because you\r\nwill not permit me to go get a diagnosis, what would I hand to the\r\nintake person to qualify?\r\n\r\nMQ: Again you did not understand my question; I asked, why you were\r\neligible for Medicaid under the technical criteria because you had a\r\nchild, you had a child under 18 years old, you could have applied for\r\nregular Medicaid,\r\n\r\nCB Uh huh\r\n\r\nCB Because the Doctor gave me a clean bill of health. If I had of\r\napplied that would have been fraud.\r\n\r\nMQ: No.\r\n\r\nMP: Wait you don\u0092t understand the question. Let me see if I can clarify\r\nthis for you. When did your daughter turn ...\r\n\r\nCB: March 23rd.\r\n\r\nMP: Of this year she turned 19?\r\n\r\nCB : 18.\r\n\r\nMP 18. She\u0092s asking you before your daughter turned 18 years of age you\r\nqualified for Medicaid under because you had a daughter under 18.\r\n\r\nCB. Uh huh.\r\n\r\nMP: She is asking why you were not receiving Medicaid then.\r\n\r\nCB. I, I do not get Medicaid unless I have to have it.\r\n\r\nCB: I no\r\n\r\nMP: OK. You had no need for it.\r\n\r\nCB: No. No.\r\n\r\nCB At the time there was no physical condition that showed I had a\r\nnecessity reason to apply for Medicaid. My focus at that time, my\r\ndaughter had attempted suicide twice. She is a rape victim, she was\r\nsubpoenaed into court, she had run away, I had to hire an attorney, we\r\nare getting the gest of this She sliced her wrist in November, I was\r\nterminated immediately after for filing a Family Medical Leave Act, I\r\nhad a daughter that was having to have therapy twice a week, plus seeing\r\na psychiatrist, plus on medication, I was having to transport her to all\r\nthe medical appointments. There was not time; it was a choice of her\r\nlife or my life.\r\n\r\nMP OK\r\n\r\nCB: Now most people in that position, and because basically, she is\r\ndisabled, weather its been qualified or not, by law, Federal Law, she is\r\ndisabled, had I neglected her, I would have been in violation. By state\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nCB: And I don\u0092t think any parent in their right mind or under those\r\nconditions trying to save her life, in which she attempted suicide again\r\nin March, which is on medical records, and ran away, and was out on the\r\nstreet and was absolutely going out of her mind, because she accused a\r\nrapist, I don't think any parent on the face of this earth, would have\r\nsat down and done  a physical exam on themselves to make sure they went\r\nand got Medicaid.\r\n\r\nMP: OK, Ms. Butler, this is submitted into evidence, the copy of the\r\nprimary, uh, your, your application, and the common application,\r\ncommonality wuestonaire, this is marked as evidence respondent exhibit\r\nnumber 1. Would you provide Ms. Butler with copies?\r\n\r\nMQ: Yes.\r\n\r\nMP: Exhibit number 2, I think your running effort comments from the\r\ndepartment, TRG screen, which is their case scenarists,\r\n\r\nMPL Exhibit number 3 is the verification log received on her avr screen\r\n\r\nMP: Exhibit 4, is the, drug exhibit, we are going to make this exhibit\r\nnumber one actually. Medicated for.\r\n\r\nMQ: and that I will need back so I can  make you a copy. Cause that is\r\nwhat I had here.\r\n\r\nMP: Ok I will give it back. This is going to be a joint exhibit number\r\n1.\r\n\r\nMP: Exhibit number 4 is the verification list, dated August 11th.\r\nExhibit number 5, is the notice of case action on when your daughter\u0092s\r\nMedicaid ended, and exhibit number 6, is mayo passages from chapter\r\n2000.\r\n\r\nCB: May I interrupt? What was the submission of the medicade ending\r\n\r\nMP: Oh this was just, the notice of case action, that shows your\r\ndaughter was eligible for Medicaid, you were ineligible for.\r\n\r\nCB: She was under Medicaid as long as we know that. She is under the\r\nHealthy Kids program.\r\n\r\nMP: Yes, they just changed categories actually, OK.\r\n\r\nMP: Prior to the hearing Ms. Butler, sent to my office to me personally,\r\nJupiter medical information is being marked as Petitioner\u0092s submission\r\nexhibit 1.\r\n\r\nCB: That was sent to Tallahassee over a month ago, so we are fully aware\r\nof that.\r\n\r\nMP: On September 11th, actually is the fax date.\r\n\r\nCB. No. It, I have copies, we, got copies, I would like to submit to the\r\ncourt later, because I was not aware this would come up, I have things\r\ndocumented I will provide the proof that the documents were already\r\nsent.\r\n\r\nMP Well well,\r\nMP: And exhibit number 2, for the petitioner, I have your doctor notes,\r\ndated September 11th and 30th, these are the only two, that I received.\r\nPetitioner has also submitted as petitioner\u0092s exhibit number three, is\r\nthe verification list dated, August 4th, and  exhibit number 4 is the\r\nblank letter, from the front and the health care districts services on\r\nthe back.\r\nCopies of these will be made after the hearing. Ok is there something\r\nadditional you  wish to submit?\r\nOr that you don\u0092t have at this time?\r\n\r\nCB: Uh, I requested a Freedom of Information Act for all my files and so\r\nfar I have not received that. I have requested from them, numerous,\r\nnumerous times, my complete file, and I have not received that, make a\r\nnote of that for the hearing. Um, they have been essentially withheld,\r\nand all my email and all other evidence shows, um, many of the\r\ndocumented responses that you got,  of having me call and be angry was\r\nbecause I first, by my phone records, can show you where she used the\r\ntelephone first.\r\n\r\nMP: That's not material to me.\r\n\r\nCB: I used rational,  every action they give was to drive me away, ,\r\nevery evidence they have put in here, everything they have done, was to\r\ndismiss to the right to the federally funded Medicaid program emergency.\r\nThat\u0092s all this is. The tape is evidence, that is what they have done\r\nbased on the evidence  I have. Its a federal law, it is in the statutes,\r\nand its fully aware, and its on Florida records, and I have all kinds of\r\ncase hearings in which its just been judgery work, its very simple, you\r\nhave a medical emergency in the state of Florida or any other state, you\r\nhave to treat it,\r\n\r\nMP: Where do you find  these ref, where did you find this information?\r\n\r\nCB: There in the, lets see they are all over the Florida Bars, they are\r\nin the Supreme Court, they in the\r\n\r\nMP: What statute, is a Florida Administrative Code, Florida Statute,\r\n\r\nCB: There have been so many trials over DCF not providing proper\r\nMedicaid, particularly out of this district, particularly out of this\r\ndistrict. Case load after case load. I have been in touch with\r\nindividuals that, have filed Florida Legal, uh, they filed Florida Class\r\naction, for this behavior. The judge told them not to do it anymore,\r\nthey are still doing it.\r\n\r\nMO: OK. Pertinent to your case, you have mentioned on more than one\r\noccasion there is a Florida Statute, or some law that provides for sixty\r\ndays of emergency Medicaid coverage for you. .\r\n\r\nCB Sixty Days?!\r\n\r\nMP: You said it would extend your Medicaid, sixty days I believe.\r\n\r\nCB: No. I never said that. I said,\r\n\r\nMP: OK what did you say?\r\n\r\nCB: As you will know from the facts of the emails I sent, which I quoted\r\nthe actual rulings by the Judges that when you have a medical emergency\r\nyou treat it. Weather you are an Alien, being an Alien does not give you\r\nsuperior rights, to be an American. There is no law that is going to\r\nuphold that one.\r\n\r\nMP: Right\r\n\r\nCB: And I, you if I have to go out and  disqualify myself as an American\r\nin order to get Medicaid, we have a problem.\r\n\r\nMQ: May I interrupt you, the, the, the the, Medicaid clause in Emergency\r\nMedicaid for aliens, does not mean that, its done in ten days or two\r\ndays, whatever they have to, meet the same technical criteria you or any\r\nother citizen has to meet.\r\n\r\nCB: OK.\r\n\r\nMQ: Which is the technicality of having children under 18 years old, the\r\nsame older as 65.\r\nCB: No. That is not what , what the, ruling says.  That's not what\r\nSocial Security Office says, That's not what the Medicaid Office says,\r\nthat's not what is in the books. That\u0092s not what the code says\r\n\r\nMP: Which Code is it?\r\n\r\nCB: I can provide it, I did provide it to your office. I sent most of\r\nit, by email,  I am not sure you got it.\r\n\r\nMP: OK I am leaving the record open, FOR, you to  supply me with the\r\ncode.\r\n\r\nCB OK\r\n\r\nMP: I am leaving the records open......\r\n\r\nCB; That is what the judges, all the judges, in every state have ruled\r\non. They said that is what the code said, that\u0092s what you are going to\r\ngo by.\r\n\r\nMP: I am going to leave the record open for  that item only.\r\n\r\nCB: You got it.\r\n\r\nMP: Which I am going to leave the record open for Cathy Butler, to send\r\nin ten days. OK, I need to get my calendar so, it will be by the close\r\nof business by that day.\r\n\r\nCB: And how would you like this provided to you?\r\n\r\nMP: Um, I would like it faxed and the original mailed. Today is\r\nSeptember 21st,\r\n\r\nCB: It\u0092s very feasible it\u0092s already out there on email.\r\n\r\nMP: By the close of business, on October 2nd, 2006 I am leaving the\r\nrecord open for one item only. Which is the\r\n\r\nCB Statutes.\r\n\r\nMP: Which is the Statute that\r\n\r\nCB I also provided the ruling that were about eight or nine rulings\r\n\r\nMP I just want the statute that,\r\n\r\nCB Now the rulings do play a part in it because you  got a superior\r\nJudge making a decision based on what the Federal Government put out.\r\nThey are pertinent to the case.\r\n\r\nMP: OK. But I, I want to be able, to go reference the Statutes that, so\r\nyou have to provide me with, the authority that.\r\n\r\nCB: Absolutely. It\u0092s is the only way you can get the full gest of it and\r\nwhat the implications are, is the rulings that are already made by the\r\nsuperior courts.\r\n\r\nMP: That\u0092s fine, I even allow you the opportunity , to submit\r\n\r\nCB: that will give you something to argue with me about, because once\r\nyou know, once...\r\n\r\nMP...The statutes to back up\r\nCB: You got it.\r\n\r\nMP: However, I still have to review the other evidence, and the\r\npertinent rules, regulations and statutes. To make my decision.\r\n\r\nMP: Although the department has not truly rendered its decision yet.\r\n\r\nCB I am aware of that.\r\n\r\nMP: So, there is also a time frame involved.\r\n\r\nCB: As my life fades away, I am fully aware of it.\r\n\r\nMP: OK\r\n\r\nMP: There will be no further testimony or evidence. This hearing is now\r\nclosed.",

Without the treatment we weren't\r\nexpecting her to live more than two more years. My grandma is the type\r\nof person who is too proud to ask for help, but now we need so much help\r\nshe is willing to ask for it. We are behind on our rent payments three\r\nmonths, my grandpa has not sold a single house in the past five months,\r\nand if we don't find a source of income soon we will be homeless come\r\nChristmas time. My grandparents cannot qualify for a small buisness loan\r\nbecause they have bad credit, and don't have any collateral.my\r\ngrandparents have always been hard workers and did good in their\r\nbuisnesses. They used to own an antique and jewelry store and it worked\r\nout really well. Another thing she used to like to do is buy houses, fix\r\nthem up, and then re-sell them at low prices for the less fortunate so\r\nthey had the chance of owning a house. My grandma is also the type of\r\nperson that doesn't liekt os how her emotions but lately she has moping\r\naround the house, and we have even seen her cry a few times because she\r\nis so stressed. My grandma has never been the type to cry. and she is\r\nknown as the \"tough cookie\" in our family and right now she hasn't been\r\nable to live up to her name. Cody and I have been working very hard at\r\nwork, but we don't get paid very much. The money Cody makes goes to his\r\ncar payment, insurance, and gas. I try and help as much as possible by\r\npaying for the groceries and little things that we need here and there.\r\nCould you please help us?  My grandma has always kept Cody and I in the\r\ndark when it comes to these kind of things, but now that we see her\r\ncrying she has told us what is wrong. It is my senior year, I am in the\r\ntop 20% of my class and i am trying to apply for grants for college.\r\nCody is also doing good in college. Now that we need the money Cody and\r\nI might have to leave school and start working full time to make the\r\nmoney we need for the bills. My grandma is trying to make her rum cakes\r\nand other things to sell, and my grandpa has high blood pressure with no\r\nmedication so he is like a walking time bomb. So my grandma says if we\r\ncould open a buisness again she would not be a burden  to the government\r\nand will be able to help others again. So if there is any way possible\r\nthat you could help us we would be very grateful sir.\r\n \r\n               Thank you,\r\n \r\n                            Samantha Meadows\r\n \r\n \r\nP.S. I have a question sir. If we have all of this money to send over\r\nseas to helpout the needy, how come we don't have the help we need over\r\nhere? Shouldn't we always start the help at home to take care of the\r\nrest?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _____  \r\n\r\nSponsored Link\r\n\r\nDon't\r\n<http://www.classesusa.com/clickcount.cfm?id=607556&goto=http%3A%2F%2Fww\r\nw.classesusa.com%2Ffeaturedschools%2Fonlinedegreesmp%2Fform-dyn1.html%3F\r\nsplovr%3D607555> quit your job - take classes online and earn\r\n<http://www.classesusa.com/clickcount.cfm?id=607556&goto=http%3A%2F%2Fww\r\nw.classesusa.com%2Ffeaturedschools%2Fonlinedegreesmp%2Fform-dyn1.html%3F\r\nsplovr%3D607555> your degree in 1 year.

PETERSBURG FOR MARINE TECHNOLOGY R&D FACILITY\r\n\r\n~ California-based research institute establishes east coast hub in\r\nFlorida ~\r\n\r\n        TALLAHASSEE \u0096 Governor Jeb Bush today announced Silicon\r\nValley-based SRI International, one of the world\u0092s leading independent\r\nresearch and technology development organizations, has selected St.\r\nPetersburg as the site for a new marine technology research facility.\r\n\r\n        \u0093The expansion of SRI\u0092s world-class research and development\r\noperations into the Tampa Bay-area exemplifies Florida\u0092s attractiveness\r\nto premier R&D institutes worldwide, and validates the strength of our\r\nmarine science and research foundation,\u0094 said Governor Jeb Bush.  \u0093Not\r\nonly will the presence of SRI have a tremendous impact on the continued\r\ngrowth of our bio-sciences base, the arrival of this renowned marine\r\ntechnology research institution to Florida will position us at the\r\nforefront of the nation's marine exploration and discovery efforts in\r\nocean science, maritime industry, and port security.  I have been\r\ndistinctly honored to work with the Florida Legislature to support the\r\nexpansion of SRI into Florida, and I applaud the outstanding\r\ncollaboration of our academic, economic development, and statewide\r\nleaders to successfully bring this visionary project from idea to\r\nreality.\u0094\r\n\r\n        The new facility will be called SRI-St. Petersburg and aims to\r\naccelerate research and development of technologies related to ocean\r\nscience, the maritime industry and port security.  SRI\u0092s expansion into\r\nFlorida is a collaborative effort with the University of South Florida\u0092s\r\nCollege of Marine Science and its Center for Ocean Technology and is\r\nsupported by the City of St. Petersburg, Pinellas County and the State\r\nof Florida.\r\n\r\n        \u0093Ocean science and technology are a growing national priority,\r\nand SRI\u0092s reputation has been built on providing high-value innovations\r\nto our clients. When we decided to broaden our R&D to include marine\r\ntechnology, Florida\u0097and the Tampa Bay area in particular\u0097became the\r\nlogical choice,\u0094 said Dr. Curtis Carlson, president and CEO of SRI\r\nInternational.  \u0093The institutional infrastructure is in place, and the\r\nbroad-based support we have received already creates momentum and\r\nterrific potential for our new operation.\u0094\r\n\r\n        The new facility will be jump-started by transitioning up to 40\r\nstaff members from the Center for Ocean Technology. SRI-St. Petersburg\r\nplans to grow to 100 jobs during the next five years, and plans to reach\r\na total of 200 jobs in the next ten years. Operations are expected to\r\nbegin by the first of the year.\r\n\r\n        \u0093As one of the fastest growing research universities in the\r\ncountry, USF is pleased to collaborate with SRI to advance our research\r\ninitiatives further along the development path. This collaboration will\r\nhave a positive and lasting impact on the university and on our region,\u0094\r\nsaid Dr. Judy Genshaft, president of University of South Florida and\r\nrecently elected Chair of the Tampa Bay Partnership.\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, Governor Bush and the Florida Legislature created the\r\n$200 million Innovation Incentive Fund program to stimulate, in part,\r\nthe attraction of world-class research institutes to the State.  A\r\ndirect beneficiary of the Innovation Fund, SRI will receive $20 million\r\nfrom the State to establish its East Coast hub in St. Petersburg.\r\nContingent upon a formal agreement, the City of St. Petersburg will also\r\nprovide a site at the Port of St. Petersburg on which to construct its\r\nnew facilities.  Funding to design and construct the new R&D facility\r\nwill be provided by the State and Pinellas County, at $5 million each,\r\nand the City will lease the new facility directly to SRI.\r\n\r\n        \u0093There\u0092s no question that we are thrilled to have a research\r\norganization as prestigious as SRI International join the St. Petersburg\r\ncommunity,\u0094 said St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Baker. \u0093Our goal is to\r\nsupport the development of high-wage jobs and high-value research that\r\nwill help further economic development in the region.\u0094\r\n\r\n        SRI\u0092s initial focus will be on research and development,\r\ntechnology transfer and commercialization of marine science. Over time,\r\nthey expect to broaden local research collaborations into additional\r\nareas, such as biosciences, nanotechnology, energy, the environment and\r\neducation.\r\n\r\n\u0093While SRI-St. Petersburg is already a collaborative effort between\r\nmultiple organizations and local governments, as it grows and develops,\r\nwe expect it to generate strategic partnerships with other industry\r\nsegments. This is exactly the kind of economic engine we need in the\r\nTampa Bay area,\u0094 said Kenneth Welch, Chairman of the Pinellas County\r\nBoard of County Commissioners.\r\n\r\n\u0093Today, we become partners with one of the best research institutes in\r\nthe world, with a record for identifying and commercializing\r\ninnovations. It strengthens our university, it strengthens our business\r\ncommunity, and it attracts attention from the world interested in\r\ninnovation, including the much sought-after venture capital community,\u0094\r\nsaid Stuart Rogel, president and CEO of the Tampa Bay Partnership.\r\n\r\n        The Governor\u0092s Office of Tourism, Trade, and Economic\r\nDevelopment worked closely with the City of St. Petersburg, Pinellas\r\nCounty Economic Development, Pinellas County Board of County\r\nCommissioners, USF, the Tampa Bay Partnership, and Enterprise Florida to\r\nsecure this project for Florida.\r\n\r\nGovernor Bush has made diversifying Florida\u0092s economy a top priority\r\nplacing particular emphasis on fostering the development of emerging\r\ntechnologies. From such emphasis has come the successful effort to bring\r\nthe expansions of The Scripps Research Institute, Burnham Institute for\r\nMedical Research and Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies into\r\nFlorida. New measures passed by the Florida Legislature to enhance\r\nFlorida\u0092s innovation economy include $200 million to create the Florida\r\nInnovation Incentive Fund to bring large scale business or research\r\nprojects to the state, $50 million for a World Class Scholars Program\r\nand a Centers of Excellence program to enhance upon our innovation\r\ninfrastructure, $45 million to expand Florida\u0092s Quick Action Closing\r\nFund and $43 million to secure Florida\u0092s position as a leader in the\r\nSpace and Aeronautics industry.\r\n\r\nFor more information on Governor Bush\u0092s economic development\r\ninitiatives, please visit  <http://www.myflorida.com> www.myflorida.com.\r\n\r\n\r\n# # #",

Part of the issue was how to\r\nassess teachers whose students do not take the FCAT.\r\n\r\nHillsborough County, which has hundreds of end-of-course exams, will\r\nmanage a clearinghouse of such tests that other districts can use. The\r\ndistrict is the only one in the state to have a STAR program approved so\r\nfar.\r\n\r\nThe department expects the clearinghouse to be in place by January for\r\ndistricts to use if they choose. \r\n\r\nBesides Hillsborough, the Florida Virtual School has said that its\r\nend-of-course exams could be used, and department officials said they\r\nwould welcome other districts' tests as well.\r\n\r\nBut many districts, including Broward, do not have their own such exams.\r\n\r\n\r\nLynn Strong, Broward's associate superintendent for human resources,\r\nsaid the district would be interested in looking at the tests.\r\n\r\n''It's a resource that we would want to review,'' she said. \r\n\r\nThe exams would be available for non-FCAT subjects mostly at the high\r\nschool level but also for middle school. \r\n\r\nDOE spokeswoman Jennifer Fennell said the department will not evaluate\r\nthe exams before offering them through the clearinghouse.\r\n\r\nEXISTING RESOURCES \r\n\r\n''They don't have to have this as part of their STAR plan, but we wanted\r\nto make sure there was an opportunity for people to capitalize on\r\nexisting resources,'' she said. ``They need to review and evaluate for\r\nthemselves.''\r\n\r\nStrong said that's exactly what Broward plans to do. \r\n\r\n''The challenge that we have is that they're not going to be available\r\nuntil January,'' Strong said. \r\n\r\nBut DOE spokeswoman Jennifer Fennell said there will be no impact on the\r\ndeadline. \r\n\r\n'If you're using it, you simply need to say, `We plan to use\r\nend-of-course exams' in your plan,'' she said. ``They can submit their\r\nplans without going into detail.''\r\n\r\nGary Itzkowitz, field staff representative for the Broward Teachers\r\nUnion, said problems still abound with the program. \r\n\r\nEven with the exams, he said, there are teachers that cannot be measured\r\nby tests, like adult education instructors and school psychologists.\r\n\r\n''It's a mess. Really,'' Itzkowitz said. ``That's about the best\r\nprofessional way I can describe it.''",

I'm forwarding this note from\r\nour friend with the soldier son. My son recently received a \"coin\" from\r\nyou apparently, because he was a soldier of the year in the National\r\nGuard. You probably won't be able to read this on the Blackberry,  but\r\nit's kinda cool. Dinah\r\n\r\n Dear Thankful, Merry Friends,\r\n He wanted a Hallmark moment.\r\n He got one.\r\n Sergeant Aric Zern started traveling on November twenty-third and two\r\ndays later he\u2039finally, finally\u2039made it all the way from Kirkuk, Iraq to\r\nour  front door, wearing the same combat fatigues and combat boots that\r\nhe\u00b9d worn  when he walked out of the desert.  He hadn\u00b9t eaten anything\r\nexcept airplane  food for two days.  He\u00b9d waited for seven hours in an\r\nairport in Kirkuk, and  then paced through another layover in Germany.\r\n\r\n    When he got here he took a cab from the airport so that he could\r\nsurprise us.  He did.\r\n     I\u00b9d been vacuuming since Thanksgiving\u2039looking out the window,\r\nwatching  the driveway.  When I worry I clean.  When I\u00b9m mad I clean.\r\nWhen I obsess I  clean.  It\u00b9s a nervous habit that beats drink, drugs, and\r\ncriminal mischief  for results.  So by the time Sergeant Zern showed up at\r\nour front door the  house sparkled, so did his smile.\r\n\r\n     Having your son come home from a war zone ranks right up there with\r\nwelcoming home returning missionaries, the births of grandbabies, and the\r\nMacy\u00b9s Labor Day shoe sale on the emotional Richter scale.\r\n\r\n     It\u00b9s hard to describe, but I can imagine that getting all the way\r\nback  home to our Father in Heaven will be a moment something like it.\r\nBecause  it\u00b9s one of those sacred moments when all Heaven and Earth hold\r\ntheir  breath.  And because the second your soldier appears there is no\r\ncloud or shadow or foolish regret to darken that heartbeat of time.  It is\r\njust smiles,  hugs, and limitless relief to have them home, in your arms,\r\nsafe.  It must be like that in Heaven when we go home a little bit.\r\n\r\n     When I saw Aric through the glass of the front door I hollered his\r\nname  and fumbled the key into the lock.  He burst through the door like a\r\nsandstorm and hugged me.  Believe me, when you\u00b9re hugged by a United\r\nStates  Army combat soldier you know it.  His arms felt like steel, but he\r\nwas the  first one to complain about being choked to death when his sister\r\npiled on.\r\n\r\n     Over his shoulder I watched through tears as Aric\u00b9s cab driver did a\r\nstrange thing.  Pulling off our driveway the cabbie drove across our yard\r\nso  that he could see into the open front door of our house.  At first I\r\ncouldn\u00b9t make sense of it, and because our front yard is basically a\r\npasture  it didn\u00b9t particularly bother me.  I mean it wasn\u00b9t like he was\r\nruining  fancy grass.\r\n\r\n     Then my mom gene kicked in, and I asked, \"Hey, Aric, you paid that\r\nguy  right?\"\r\n\r\n     Aric looked over his shoulder and said in his best \u0152come on mom\u00b9\r\nvoice,  \u00b3Sure and tipped him twenty bucks.\u00b2\r\n\r\n     \u00b3What in the world is he doing?\u00b2  We paused and puzzled a bit. Then I\r\nrealized what Aric\u00b9s cab driver was doing.\r\n\r\n     His cab driver recognizing that something special was about to happen\r\nhad taken his opportunity to be a witness.  An immigrant to this country,\r\nhe\u00b9d driven Sergeant Zern home and told him, \u00b3I will pray for you my\r\nfriend,\u00b2 in a thick Indian accent.  He\u00b9d known a hero when he saw one, and\r\nhe\u00b9d wanted to see that hero get all the way home.  It was a sacred moment\r\nand they can be hard to resist.  I waved and smiled and then quietly shut\r\nour front door.\r\n\r\n     And it was a Hallmark moment.\r\n   Linda L. Zern (Proud Mother of an American Soldier)",

My aunt, Virginia Esposito, received\r\na letter/questionaire back in September from the Office of Financial\r\nRegulation regarding an investigation of Trans Continental Airlines.\r\nShe promptly returned the questionaire to the OFR.  On October 30th, She\r\nrequested that the balance of her Investment Savings Account\r\n($33,815.08) be withdrawn.  She was told that she would receive the\r\ncheck within 3 weeks. Now that the time has passed when she calls to\r\ninquire about the status of her check she receives conflicting\r\ninformation.  She contacted Danielle Brooks with the OFR and was told\r\nthat some people are receiving their checks and others are not.  To me\r\nor to anyone this does not sound like the answer she deserves.  Do you\r\nhave any suggestions as to whom we would contact to have this matter\r\nresolved?
